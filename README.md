#  Hi, I’m Arvinth

  Pre-final year B.Tech student (CSE – AI)  
  Bengaluru, India | Chennai / HYD
  Data Science • Machine Learning • Applied LLMs

I’m a computer science undergraduate focused on building **practical, data-driven solutions** using **Python, SQL, machine learning, and LLM-based systems**. I enjoy working across the full pipeline — from **data preprocessing and feature engineering** to **model evaluation and insight delivery**.

## 🔧 What I Work With

**Programming & Data**
- Python, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), C

**Machine Learning**
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- Regression, Classification, Clustering  
- Feature Engineering, Data Validation, Model Evaluation

**LLMs & NLP**
- GPT, BERT, Transformer-based models  
- Prompt Engineering  
- API-based model inference

**Data Visualization**
- Streamlit, PowerBI, Dash  
- Matplotlib

**Tools**
- Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Linux, Docker

##   What I’m Building

- LLM-powered analytical tools to extract insights from structured and unstructured data  
- End-to-end ML pipelines covering data cleaning, training, and evaluation  
- Customer segmentation & data mining systems  
- Interactive dashboards for non-technical users  

I’m particularly interested in **applied data science** where models directly support **business decision-making**.
